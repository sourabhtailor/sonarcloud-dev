# Amounts

Pre-generated wordlists based on [Common Security Issues in Financially-Oriented Web Applications](https://soroush.me/downloadable/common-security-issues-in-financially-orientated-web-applications.pdf) PDF.

Created to fuzz amounts, quantities, or any other numerical values.

Bypass minimum and maximum restrictions, cause unintended behavior and errors, etc.

Tool to create such wordlists can be found at [ivan-sincek/amounts](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/amounts). Feel free to create and add more wordlists on your own. Works with integer and float numerical values.
