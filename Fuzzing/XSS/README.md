# XSS
This is a directory for XSS wordlists. 

They are for testing xss vulnerabilities manually or automatically using tools. The XSS wordlists are further split into two more categories, `human-friendly` and `robot-friendly`.

 The `human-friendly` category is for manual testings and as such, have comments left untouched. 
 
 The `robot-friendly` is for automated tools like ZAP or burpsuite to use. Minor changes may be required and as such, you should look out for the `README.md` file in each of the directories to know what to change.
